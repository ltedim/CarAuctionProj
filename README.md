Problem statement: Car Auction Management System
<a>


Notes
- I assumed that we will have a single DTO for entity, and remove or rewrite any property accordingly to the logic.
- InMemory DBs does not allow transactions but I let the example code commented. <a href="https://codeopinion.com/testing-with-ef-core/">Info link<a>
- Included some comments in the code about some ways of thinking, future improvements and "my business logic".
